Tutorial for GitHub

Hello, 

I am learning to code.  I started tinkering with HTML when I was younger.  As things have progressed I started learning CSS to make fun little hobby sites.  Now I am think of a career in web development.  I am not sure part, but I think I have time to figure it out as I am currently learning Javascript and that with HTML and CCS are kind of the foundation of coding.   

There is no much intresting about me.  I am a homebody and like to spend my day on the computer.
